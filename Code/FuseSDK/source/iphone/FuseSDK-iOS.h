 @brief This method retrieves server configuration values.
 @details The Fuse SDK provides a method to store game configuration variables that are provided to the application on start.  These are different than "Game Data" values since they are stored on a per-game basis, and not a per-user basis.
 
 In the Fuse dashboard, navigate to the 'configuration' tab in your game view.  You can edit the "Game Data" section by adding keys and associated data values.  Values can be 256 characters in length and support UTF-8 characters.
 
 @code
 
 NSString *my_val = [FuseSDK getGameConfigurationValue:@"my_key"];
 
 if (my_val != nil)
 {
    // always check against 'nil' before using the value
 }
 
 @endcode
 
 Values are update in the client each time a session is started from the Springboard or system tray. To find out when values are valid in the device, you can use the following \<FuseDelegate\> callback method that indicates when the values are ready to be inspected.
 
 @code
 
 BOOL has_game_config_returned = NO;
 
 -(void) gameConfigurationReceived
 {
    has_game_config_returned = YES;
 
    // You can now access your updated server-side data, either here or somewhere else in your code
    NSString *funny_val = [FuseSDK getGameConfigurationValue:@"not_funny"];
 }
 
 @endcode
 
 It is recommended that a default value be present on the device in case the user has not or never connects to the Internet.
 
 @param _key [NSString*] This is the key for which the value is requested.
 @retval [NSString*] This is the value for the corresponding key.
 @see startSession:delegate:withOptions: for information on setting up the \<FuseDelegate\>
