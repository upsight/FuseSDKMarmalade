The returned value is only psuedo-accurate in that it does not account for request time and delays - so it is the time on the server when the request was received but not the time when the value returns to the device.  This is generally used to prevent time exploits in games where such situations could occur (by a user changing their device time).

#pragma mark User Game Data
/*!
 @brief This method is used to store per-user persistent game data on the Fuse servers while specifying a mater key value for the key->value pairs in the dictionary.
 @details User information is stored in key->value pairs.  A dictionary is used to store the key value pairs that are passed in to the method.  Keys in the dictionary must be strings, while value data types fall in to two categories: the first being variables that can be cast to strings (int, bool, float, string), while the second is binary data in the form of a NSData* object.  There is currently no restriction on the length of the value passed to the server, however if requests become so large they could create problems and this policy will have to be changed.  To receive information on whether the call was made successfully, a \<FuseGameDataDelegate\> delegate can be optionally passed to the method (pass 'nil' if not required).  An example of how to create a dictionary and send it to the Fuse system is as follows:
 
 @code
 
 NSMutableDictionary *dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithCapacity:4];
 
 [dict setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:currentPoints] forKey:@"points"];
 [dict setValue:[NSNumber numberWithBool:hasPlayed] forKey:@"played"];
 [dict setValue:userName forKey:@"name"];
 
 NSData *binaryData = [[NSData alloc] initWithBytes:ptr length:1024];
 
 [dict setValue:binaryData forKey:@"binary_blob"];
 
 [FuseAPI setGameData:dict Delegate:self];
 
 @endcode
 
 To register a \<FuseGameDataDelegate\> delegate, create a class with the following interface:
 
 @code
 @interface YourDataObject : NSObject <FuseGameDataDelegate> 
 {
 }
 @end
 
 @endcode
 
 In the implementation of the delegate object, add this delegate method to receive set data callbacks:
 
 @code
 
 @implementation YourDataObject
 
 -(void) gameDataError:(NSNumber*)_error
 {
    // An error has occurred in setting game data
    // see kFuseGameDataErrors for all error values
    int error = [_error intValue];
 }
 
 -(void) gameDataSetAcknowledged:(NSNumber*)_request_id
 {
    // An acknowledgement has been received by the device from the server indicating that the data has been updated
    int request_id = [_request_id intValue];
 }
 
 @end
 
 @endcode 
 
 @param _data [NSMutableDictionary*] The data to be stored on the server
 @param _delegate [id] The \<FuseGameDataDelegate\> delegate to receive callbacks (optional - pass 'nil' if not required)

/*!
 * @brief This method is used to store per-user persistent game data on the Fuse servers while specifying a master key value for the key->value pairs in the dictionary.

For instance, if you have a game with cars and you need to send information on each car that a user has, a dictionary could be sent for each car using a differentiating parent key value to separate the dictionary from others.  In addition, this method *can not* be used to send binary data unlike  setGameData:Delegate:.

 In the Fuse dashboard, navigate to the 'configuration' tab in your game view.  You can edit the "Game Data" section by adding keys and associated data values.  Values can be 256 characters in length and support UTF-8 characters.
