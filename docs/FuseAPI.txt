FuseAPI Function Documentation

Below is a list of calls you can make to the FuseAPI extension.
Note: All this documentation can also be found in FuseAPI.h
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**+------------------+
// | Session Creation |
// +------------------*/
/*	
* @brief This function is used to initiate all communication with the Fuse system (and register a FuseCallback)
* @details The startSession function is used to bootstrap all communications with the Fuse system. This should be called at the cold start 
* of the application (application onCreate() method or the main activity onCreate() method).
*
* When a session has been established by Fuse system, a FUSEAPI_SESSION_STARTED or FUSEAPI_SESSION_LOGIN_ERROR callback will be sent to the registered callback object
*
* @param key [String] This is the 36-character API key assigned by the Fuse system.  Your API key is generated when you add your App to the Fuse dashboard system.  
* It can be found in the configuration tab in a specific game, or in the "Integrate API" section of the dashboard. 
* The API key is a 36-digit unique ID of the form 'aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee'.
*
* in FuseAPI/docs/Callbacks.txt:
* @see FUSEAPI_SESSION_STARTED for more information on the callback function
* @see FUSEAPI_SESSION_LOGIN_ERROR for more information on handling errors occurred when trying to start a session
*/

/*
* @brief This function is used to Setup Google Cloud Messaging service or iOS push notifications for this app.  
* @details To use this function you must have registered for GCM through Google's API portal: https://code.google.com/apis/console.  A good explanation of GCM can be found here:
* http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html
* Please see FuseAPI/docs/README.txt for how to set up the Android manifests and change notification icons
*
* NOTE: the projectID paramter is ignored on iOS
*
* @param GCM_Project_Number [String] This is the Project Number obtained after registering for GCM through Google's portal. This parameter is not used for iOSs

/**+------------------+
// | Analytics Events |
// +------------------*/
/*
* @brief This function is used to register a named event in the Fuse system.
* @details This function logs the time and frequency of an event within a given game session.  The input string can be anything that is relevant to the 
* design of the game but should be easily understandable when read by users in the Fuse system.
* 
* It is advisable to avoid recording events at a high rate as this could negatively impact both application and server performance.  
* For example, a good practice would be to issue an event at the start of a level (i.e. 'Level 1') or when a purchase is made.  
* It is not advised to issue any event in each draw loop as this would create a tremendous amount of overhead and server traffic.
*
* The maximum length of a registered event is 256 characters, and each application is limited to a maximum 256 separate named events.
*
* An example call would be:
*
* @code
	FuseAPIRegisterEvent("Level 1 Started");
* @endcode
*
* @param event [String] The event name to be logged

* used to prevent time exploits in games where such situations could occur (by a user changing their device time).

* To get the time, it is a two step process.  First a request is made to the API using this function.
* Then, a FUSEAPI_TIME_UPDATED callback is triggered in the FuseCallback object with the result.

* must be strings, while value data types fall in to two categories: the first being variables that can be cast to strings (int, boolean, float, string), while the second

* and the structs used to pass information from FuseAPI to callback handlers.

/*
* @brief This function returns the local friends list of the logged in user
* @details Similar to updateFriendsListFromServer, this function merely returns the local copy of the friends list.  
* The local version of the list can differ from the server version in two ways.  Firstly, friends could accept an invite in another device, 
* clearing both users to show up in each others list.  This server updated is not signaled to the client devices.  Secondly, given that there 
* are propagation delays and HTTP request ordering issues, any "action" (adding a friend, accepting or deleting) will take a few seconds to 
* reach the server. A request to get the server version very close to one of these actions could result in the list not being representative of the final list.
* 
* To get the local friends list:
* 
* @code
	
	// first, retrieve the friends list from the server	
	FuseAPIUpdateFriendsListFromServer();
	
	// once you receive the FUSEAPI_FRIENDSLIST_UPDATED callback, you can query for the friend's list
	int numFriends;
	FusePlayer* local_friends_list = FuseAPIGetFriendsList(&numFriends);
 
* @endcode
* 
* @param numPlayers [int*] Reference to an int variable that will contain the number of friends in the list
* @retval [FusePlayer*] The local version of the user's friends list
* @see FuseAPIUpdateFriendsListFromServer for more information on retrieving the list from the Fuse servers and the format of the friends list dictionary

 * the invite (see FuseAPIAcceptFriend) before both users are shown in each others list.  A FUSEAPI_FRIEND_ADDED callback is made once the friend is accepted.
